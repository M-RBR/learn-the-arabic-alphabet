# Arabic Alphabet Flashcards

This is the first project I built with React - an interactive learning tool for the Arabic alphabet with flip cards and pronunciation examples.

Add live preview. 

## Project Overview

This application helps users learn the 28 letters of the Arabic alphabet through interactive flashcards. Each card displays:
- The Arabic letter on the front
- The letter name and an example word button on the back
- A modal with detailed information when "Example" is clicked

## Features
